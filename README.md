# Hello Charbel !

This is the submission of Lab 3.

## SQL Part
For the SQL part it can all be found in the "InMindLab3-SQL.txt" it contains all the code that was used to complete the tasks as well as some comments to explain the thought process.

## Linq part 

For the Linq part, the code can be found in the Services/LibraryServices.cs file. All the endpoints were added in the Controllers/StudentController.cs file and the models for the Authors and Books can be found in the Models/Author.cs and Models/Books.cs files.

**`Confession time:`** Halfway through writing the service, I noticed that I named the file as Books.cs and not Book.cs. I was afraid of how much code would break if I removed the "s" and therefore decided to keep it. I hope you understand ._.
